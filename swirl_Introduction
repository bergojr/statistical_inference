| In this lesson, we'll briefly introduce basics of statistical inference, the process
| of drawing conclusions "about a population using noisy statistical data where
| uncertainty must be accounted for". In other words, statistical inference lets
| scientists formulate conclusions from data and quantify the uncertainty arising from
| using incomplete data.

| Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference?

1: Testing the efficacy of a new drug
2: Constructing a medical image from fMRI data
3: Recording the results of a statistics exam
4: Polling before an election to predict its outcome

Selection: 3

| Nice work!

  |=======================                                                      |  30%
| So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying
| the uncertainty associated with those conclusions. The uncertainty could arise from
| incomplete or bad data.
|===============================                                              |  40%
| Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data?

1: Small sample size
2: A poorly designed study
3: A randomly selected sample of population
4: Selection bias

| Excellent job!

  |======================================                                       |  50%
| So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a
| population. Which of the following would a scientist using statistical inference
| techniques consider a problem?

1: Our study has no bias and is well-designed
2: Our data sample is representative of the population
3: Contaminated data

Selection: 3

| Excellent work!

| Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference in action?

1: Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment
2: Counting sheep
3: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate
4: Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease

Selection: 2

| That's the answer I was looking for.

  |======================================================                       |  70%
| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic
| (singular) is a number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer
| information about a population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an
| experiment. Deterministic processes, such as computing means or variances, applied
| to random variables, produce additional random variables which have their own
| distributions. It's important to keep straight which distributions you're talking
| about.

  |==============================================================               |  80%
| Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which
| uses "long run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically
| distributed repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate
| for a hypothesis is updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require
| an understanding of probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
