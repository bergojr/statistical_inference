  |===                                                                          |   3%
| In this lesson, we'll review basic ideas of probability, the study of quantifying
| the likelihood of particular events occurring. Note the similarity between the words
| probability and probably. Every time you use the latter word you're implying that an
| event is more likely than not to occur.

  |=====                                                                        |   7%
| The first step in understanding probability is to see if you understand what
| outcomes of an experiment are possible. For instance, if you were rolling a single,
| fair die once, how many outcomes are possible?

1: 1
2: Too many

| The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the number
| of ways that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the experiment. Since
| there are 6 possible outcomes to the experiment of rolling a die, and we assume the
| die is fair, each outcome is equally likely. So what is the probability of rolling a
| 2?

1: 0
2: 2/6
3: 1/3
4: 1/6

Selection: 2

| That's not exactly what I'm looking for. Try again.

| The '2' is one of six possibilities.

| Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of ways that E
| could occur to the number of all possible outcomes or events, the probability of E,
| denoted P(E), is always between 0 and 1. Impossible events have a probability of 0
| (since they can't occur) and events that are certain to occur have a probability of
| 1.

| If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en, then
| the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the outcomes are
| equally likely, as in the case of a fair die, then the probability of each is 1/n.

...

  |===================                                                          |  24%
| If A and B are two independent events then the probability of them both occurring is
| the product of the probabilities. P(A&B) = P(A) * P(B)

| Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling the same
| number two times in a row?

Selection: 2

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again.

| Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability is 1.
| The second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so that has a
| probability of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1 * 1/6.

| Now consider the experiment of rolling 2 dice, one red and one green. Assume the
| dice are fair and not loaded. How many distinct outcomes are possible?

| If an event E can occur in more than one way and these ways are disjoint (mutually
| exclusive) then P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of each of the ways in which
| it can occur.

| Rolling these two dice, what's the probability of rolling a 10?

1: 1/6
2: 0
3: 3/36
4: 2/36

Selection: 1

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again.

| Since the highest possible dice roll is a '6', the only combinations which give
| '10' are 4+6 and 5+5. The first occurs in two ways - red dice gets '4' and green
| gets '6' OR red gets '6' and green gets '4'.

  |=====================================                                        |  48%
| The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum of
| their individual probabilities minus the probability of their intersection. P(A U
| B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B).

...

  |========================================                                     |  52%
| It's easy to see why this is. Calculating P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that are in
| both A and B twice, so they're overcounted. The probability of the intersection of
| the two events, denoted as A&B, must be subtracted from the sum.

| Back to rolling two dice. Which expression represents the probability of rolling an
| even number or a number greater than 8?

1: (18+10)/36
2: (18+10-2)/36
3: (18+10-4)/36
4: (18+4-2)/36

Selection: 4

| Not exactly. Give it another go.

| The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2 or 18/36. There are 10 ways of
| rolling a number greater than '8' - 4 ways for rolling '9', 3 for '10', 2 for '11'
| and 1 for '12'. How big is the intersection between rolling an even number and
| those greater than '8'?

1: (18+4-2)/36
2: (18+10-2)/36
3: (18+10-4)/36
4: (18+10)/36

Selection: 3

| All that practice is paying off!

  |=============================================                                |  59%
| It follows that if A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive, i.e. only one of
| them can occur, then P(A U B) = P(A)+P(B) .

| Use the answer to the previous question and the fact that the sum of all outcomes

| A deck of cards is a set of 52 cards, 4 suits of 13 cards each. There are two red
| suits, diamonds and hearts, and two black suits, spades and clubs. Each of the 13
| cards in a suit has a value - an ace which is sometimes thought of as 1, a number
| from 2 to 10, and 3 face cards, king, queen, and jack. We've created a deck in R
| for you. Type 'deck' to see it now.
